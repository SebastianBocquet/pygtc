pygtc.py
=========

Make a sweet giant triangle confusogram (GTC) plot with just one line of code. A
GTC is basically a corner (or triangle) plot, but more exciting!

Read `the documentation <http://pygtc.readthedocs.io/>`_, or check out `demo.ipynp <https://github.com/SebastianBocquet/pygtc/blob/master/demo.ipynb>`_.

Works great with the output from ``emcee``.

Install with pip: ``pip install pygtc``
